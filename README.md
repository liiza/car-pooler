# Car pooler

The idea was to help planning the car pooling for the reoccuring visits to the summer cottage. 
The cottage has only limited number of parking slots and so the idea is to drive as little cars over there as possible.
The idea of this app is to everyone insert the times they will be there and amount of seats available in their car.
